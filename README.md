# Quake Live CTF Guide
CTF basics, so you can suck less.

## FAQ

`Q:` Why this?

`A:` Because people new to CTF tend to ruin the game for others on the server by not knowing what to do or how to play the mode.

`Q:` Some maps are missing and some maps are missing most of the positions, why?

`A:` Because there was no time or will to complete the guide, either by Raist or by myself (esdf). That's also highly unlikely to change. The guide will stay the way it is now. Feel free to contribute.

`Q:` What are these pickups you're writing about?

`A:` They are the closest thing QuakeLive currently has to matchmaking. Join discord.io/houseofquake to play some games.

`Q:` I remember this guide on steam, weren't there some demos and configs?

`A:` Yup, those got lost over the years. Try asking in the pickup server mentioned above for demos if you want. Maybe someone helps out.

`Q:` Anything else missing?

`A:` Yup, configs and Spider Crossings section, unfortunately. Those also got lost, I probably did a poor paste from pdf version to Steam. 

`Q:` Who made this?

`A:` Raist and myself (esdf/vidje).
